# Problem Statement:

## Level 1:

In the level one of the game as given consists of 2 players P1 and P2 The game is played on a square board with 5 by 5 blocks.

Each player has 5 characters that start from his end.

Characters can be of the following types.
1. Pawn:	In one move, it moves 1 block straight in any direction (L or R or F or B) - Left, Right, Forward, Backward - These are relative to the player
We've used Object Oriented Programming to deal with this problem statement and exception handling is used with object gameError for handling errors

Add below character types to the game:

1. Hero1:	In one move, it moves 2 blocks straight in any direction, and kills anything in its path
2. Hero2:	In one move, it moves 2 blocks diagonally in any direction, and kills anything in its path

H1:L means Hero1 to left, H2:FL means move H2 to forward-left direction

Implement all R,L,F,B for H1 and FL, FR, BL, BR for H2
